The program reads the file and decompress the file and print it to stdout
## complexity 
    since we will traverse all over the file the we will go through n (number of characters=(length of the file/2) 
    and multiply ever character with the number before it (a0+a1+......+an) submission of the number
    O(Σaᵢ)
